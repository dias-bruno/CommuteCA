# Introduction

This Rmarkdown file is part of the
[**CommuteCA**](https://github.com/dias-bruno/CommuteCA) package.
This package was created in conjunction with the office of the
[*Research Data Center* at *McMaster
University*](https://rdc.mcmaster.ca/), the [*Sherman Centre for Digital
Scholarship*](https://scds.ca/) and the [*Mobilizing
Justice*](https://mobilizingjustice.ca/)[^1].

[^1]: The Mobilizing Justice project is a multidisciplinary and
    multi-sector collaboration with the objective of understand and
    address transportation poverty in Canada and to improve the
    well-being of Canadians at risk of transport poverty. The Social
    Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSRHC) has provided
    funding for the project, which was created by an unprecedented
    alliance of academics from various Canadian provinces and
    institutions, transportation firms, and nonprofit organizations

The [**CommuteCA**](https://github.com/dias-bruno/CommuteCA) R
package was created to develop standardized methods for transport
analysis in research, particularly for analysis using the [*2021 Census of
Population*](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/index-eng.cfm) from Statistics Canada. We focused our efforts on the [_Commuting Reference Guide_](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/98-500/011/98-500-x2021011-eng.cfm),
which provides valuable variables and information on commuting for the Canadian population aged 15 and older living in private households. 

Considering the number of workers and employment opportunities obtained
from the [*2021 Census of
Population*](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/index-eng.cfm),
this R markdown aims to create a methodology to obtain Hansen-type
accessibility [@hansen1959] and spatial accessibility [@soukhov2023],
for all Canadian provinces and territories, considering different modes
of travel.

## Data

The dataset used in this demonstration is test data produced to
replicate the variables available in the original Census of Population.
The test data contains 200,000 rows and 17 columns. As in the original census data,
each row refers to a respondent and each column refers to a
variable[^2].\
The creation of test data was necessary because the surveys
provided by Statistics Canada are confidential and cannot be accessed
outside of a Research Data Center.

[^2]: You can check out more information about the Census on the
    [Dictionary
    website](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/index-eng.cfm).

If you want to work with the original Census dataset, the process for
obtaining the accessibility measures will be the same as for the
test data, except that you will have to update the address of the
file in the chunk[^3] called *load-census-data*.

[^3]: A code chunk is an executable part of the R code

For this R markdown, we'll use the following variables[^4]:

[^4]: The explanation of each variable can be found in the [*2021 Census
    of Population's
    website*](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/index-eng.cfm).

: Census variables used in this R markdown.

A dissemination area (DA) is a small, relatively stable geographic unit
composed of one or more adjacent dissemination blocks. It is the
smallest standard geographic area for which all census data are
disseminated. DAs cover all Canadian territory.

We will also use the travel time table created in the previous step, in
the R markdown called *03_travel_times.Rmd*.[^5].

[^5]: Although we have provided test census data for all Canadian
    provinces and territories, we have produced a travel table only for
    the city of Toronto. So if you want to test the methodology for
    other cities or regions, you'll have to generate a travel time for
    the corresponding study area with *01_travel_times.Rmd*

The travel times table has the following variables:

| **Variable** | **Description**                                                                   |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| PRCDDA       | Refers to the DA defined as the origin.                                           |
| CMAUID       | Census metropolitan area or census agglomeration of the DA defined as the origin. |
| PWDA         | Refers to the DA defined as the destination.                                      |
| travel_time  | Estimated travel time in minutes from origin to destination.                      |
| PwMode       | Transportation mode used to calculate the travel time.                            |

# Let's code!

<!-- The methodology for obtaining the accessibility measures using the Canadian -->
<!-- Census consists of the following steps: -->

<!-- 1.  First, we estimate the travel time for each transportation mode using the [{r5r}](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/fitdistrplus/index.html) package [@Pereira2021], considering all possible combinations of dissemination areas of the selected study area. The methodology used to obtain the travel time table is in the *01_travel_times.Rmd*.  -->

<!-- 2.  After this, we extract the commute time to work declared by the Census respondents, in order to calibrate the impedance functions for each transportation mode. -->

<!-- 3.  We then apply the impedance functions to the travel time table. -->

<!-- 4.  Next, we create a land use table. This table contains the labour force population and the number of job opportunities for each dissemination area. -->

<!-- 5.  We join the travel time and labour force tables, creating the accessibility table. This last table has all the data needed to carry out the accessibility analysis.  -->

<!-- 6.  Finally, we perform the Hansen accessibility type and the spatial availability. -->

## Reading files

### Census 

Reading census data and creating a R data frame[^1]:

[^1]: For this demonstration, we will use the case of the city of
    Toronto. If you want to use the other options, the original data
    from the Census in an RDC office or the test data for all
    locations in Canada, *update* the address in the chunk.
    
```{r}
# For the original Census data set
files_address <- paste0(here(),"/data-ignore-inputs/census_test_toronto.csv") # insert-the-RDC-address!!!
census <- read.csv(files_address, header = TRUE)
```

If the original Census dataset available in the RDC is not in .csv (comma-separated values) format but is instead provided in other formats such as SPSS, SAS, or SAS Data, you can use the foreign package (a built-in R library) to import it:

```{r}
# library(foreign)
# foreign::read.dta(files_address) # For Stata
# foreign::read.spss(files_address) # For SPSS
# There are many other options! You can search for this library in the 'Packages' window and explore additional functions for reading your file. 
```

Or if you have installed *CommuteCA*, you can access the *test* data:

```{r load-census-data}
# data("census_test_toronto")
# census <- census_test_toronto
```

| â ï¸**NOTE:**  If the code above did not run correctly, you probably are experiencing a file address error. Try to identify the correct address and update the chunk named `census-file-address` to continue.

It's possible to filter the data frame by administrative (province
and/or census division) and/or statistical (census metropolitan areas
and census agglomerations)[^10]. The chunk below shows how to make this
procedure:

[^10]: As said before, we will perform our analysis for the city of
    Toronto. If you want to select a specific area to work, uncomment
    the code above that applies to your case and select the apropriate
    code of your interest unit. Please, check the dictionary to have
    more informations about the [provinces
    code](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/tab/index-eng.cfm?ID=t1_8),
    [census
    divisions](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/Definition-eng.cfm?ID=geo008),
    and [census metropolitan
    areas](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/Definition-eng.cfm?ID=geo009)

```{r filter-boundaries}
code <- 3520 # census division of Toronto

# Filtering by census division
 census_filtered <- census %>%
                    filter(PCD == code) # Only select respondents who live in  Toronto
 
census <- census %>%
                    filter(PCD == code) # Only select respondents who live in  Toronto
```

```{r select-variables-census}
census_filtered <- census_filtered %>% 
          dplyr::select("PRCDDA",
                        "PCD",
                        "CompW1",
                        "PwMode",
                        "PWDist",
                        "PWDUR",
                        "PWDA",
                        "PWCD")
```

According to the census code book, the variable 'PwMode' has the
following possible values:

-   -3: Not applicable.
-   1: Car, truck or van - as a driver.
-   2: Car, truck or van - as a passenger.
-   3: Bus.
-   4: Subway or elevated rail.
-   5: Light rail, streetcar or commuter train.
-   6: Passenger ferry.
-   7: Walked.
-   8: Bicycle.
-   9: Motorcycle, scooter or moped.
-   10: Other method.

We'll rename the travel modes to facilitate the readability of the data.
Additionally, we'll remove from our analysis travel modes signed as
'Other methods':

```{r rename-PwMode}
census_filtered <- census_filtered  %>% 
                   filter(PwMode < 10) %>% 
                   mutate(PwMode = case_when(PwMode > 0 & PwMode <= 2 ~ "Car/motor",
                                             PwMode == 9 ~ "Car/motor",
                            PwMode >= 3 & PwMode <= 6  ~ "Transit",
                            PwMode == 7  ~ "Walk",
                            PwMode == 8  ~ "Bike"),
         
         PwMode = factor(PwMode, levels = c("Bike", "Walk", "Car/motor", "Transit"))) %>%
  filter(PwMode %in% c("Bike", "Walk", "Car/motor", "Transit"))

census <- census  %>% 
                   mutate(PwMode = case_when(PwMode > 0 & PwMode <= 2 ~ "Car/motor",
                                             PwMode == 9 ~ "Car/motor",
                            PwMode >= 3 & PwMode <= 6  ~ "Transit",
                            PwMode == 7  ~ "Walk",
                            PwMode == 8  ~ "Bike"),
         
         PwMode = factor(PwMode, levels = c("Bike", "Walk", "Car/motor", "Transit")))
```

```{r}
census_workers <- census_filtered %>% 
  filter(PCD == code  & PWCD == code)
```

```{r}
census_expanded <- expand.grid(PRCDDA = unique(census_filtered$PRCDDA),
                               PwMode = unique(census_filtered$PwMode))
```

### Accessibility measures 

Setting the folder with the accessibility measures: 

```{r read-accessibility}
# Folder with the accessibility files 
measures_folder <- paste0(here::here(),"/data-raw/output/PCD3520/DA/accessibility-measures/")

# Read file job spatial availability by mode
SA <- read.csv(paste0(measures_folder, "SA_mode_original_RDC.csv"))
```

Preparing the accessibility file: 

```{r}
SA_mode <- census_expanded %>% 
  left_join(SA, by = c("PRCDDA","PwMode")) %>%
  mutate(SA_im = replace_na(SA_im, 0))
```

### Travel time matrix 

Reading the travel time table with the impedance measures:

```{r read-ttm_f}
# Folder  
ttm_folder <- paste0(here(),"/data-raw/output/PCD3520/DA/travel_times/") # Update it if necessary 

# Read file
ttm_f <- read.csv(paste0(ttm_folder, "ttm_f.csv"))
```

### Spatial files 

Reading the dissemination areas spatial file:

```{r read-ttm_f}
# Folder  
directory_spatial_files <- paste0(here(),"/data-raw/output/PCD3520/spatial-files/") # Update it if necessary 

# Read file
da_file <- st_read(paste0(directory_spatial_files, "dissemination_areas.shp"))
```

## Creating folder to save files

Creating a directory to export the figures and tables:

```{r directory-export}
diretorio_export_figures <- paste0(here(),"/data-raw/output/PCD3520/DA/spatial-filter-figures/") # Update the address to export the data, if necessary

if(!dir.exists(diretorio_export_figures)){
  dir.create(diretorio_export_figures, recursive = TRUE)}

diretorio_export_tables <- paste0(here(),"/data-raw/output/PCD3520/DA/spatial-filter-measures/") # Update the address to export the data, if necessary

if(!dir.exists(diretorio_export_tables)){
  dir.create(diretorio_export_tables, recursive = TRUE)}
```

# Spatial filters 

## Spatial filter based on the commute distance (straight-line) 

```{r}
mtx_distance_binary <- spdep::nb2mat(spdep::poly2nb(da_file), style = "B", zero.policy = TRUE)
```

```{r}
diag(mtx_distance_binary) <- 1

rownames(mtx_distance_binary) <- da_file$DAUID
colnames(mtx_distance_binary) <- da_file$DAUID
```

```{r}
# Calculo and values eigenvectors
ev_dist <- eigen(mtx_distance_binary)

# Pego so os vectors e crio um dataframe 
eigv_df <- as.data.frame(Re(ev_dist$vectors))

# altero o nome das colunas 
colnames(eigv_df) <- paste0("EV", seq_len(ncol(eigv_df)))

# adiciono nesse df de vectors o id do PRCDDA 
weight_matrix_eigv_dist <- cbind(eigv_df, PRCDDA = as.numeric(rownames(mtx_distance_binary)))
```


```{r sf-all-modes}
modes <- unique(census_workers$PwMode)

mode_results_dist <- list()

for (mode in modes) {
  cat("Creating the spatial filter (distance) for the transportation mode:", mode, "\n")

  # Creating a df with the accessibility values
  y <- SA_mode %>%
    filter(PwMode == mode) %>%
    left_join(weight_matrix_eigv_dist, by = c("PRCDDA" = "PRCDDA")) %>%
    mutate(x = 1, Sf_dist = 0)
  
  # Creating the spatial filter (Sf_dist)
  for (ev_name in names(y)[startsWith(names(y), "EV")]) {
    formula <- as.formula(paste("SA_im ~ x + Sf_dist +", ev_name))
    model <- lm(formula, data = y)
    coefs <- summary(model)$coefficients

    if (ev_name %in% rownames(coefs)) {
      p_value <- coefs[ev_name, "Pr(>|t|)"]
      B_value <- coefs[ev_name, "Estimate"]

      if (!is.na(p_value) && p_value < 0.05) {
        y$Sf_dist <- y$Sf_dist + B_value * y[[ev_name]]
      }
    }
  }
 
 mode_results_dist[[mode]] <- y
}
```

Visualizing creating a data frame with all spatial filters and accessibility:

```{r sf_dist-df}
spatial_filter_dist <- as.data.frame(bind_rows(mode_results_dist, .id = "PwMode")) %>%
  dplyr::select(PRCDDA, PwMode, SA_im, Sf_dist)
```

Pearson  correlation between job spatial availability and spatial filter by transportation mode: 

```{r sf-correlations}
correlations <- spatial_filter_dist %>%
  group_by(PwMode) %>%
  summarise(correlation = cor(SA_im, Sf_dist, use = "complete.obs")) 

correlations
```

Creating a scatter plot figure: 

```{r sf-dist-plot}
r2_labels <- spatial_filter_dist %>%
  group_by(PwMode) %>%
  summarise(r2 = summary(lm(Sf_dist ~ SA_im))$r.squared) %>%
  mutate(label = paste0("RÂ² = ", round(r2, 3)))

spatial_filter_dist_fig <- ggplot(spatial_filter_dist, aes(x = SA_im, y = Sf_dist)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "#4b84db", linewidth = 0.55) +
  geom_text(data = r2_labels, 
            aes(x = -Inf, y = Inf, label = label), 
            hjust = -0.1, vjust = 1.1, inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ PwMode, scales = "free") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Job spatial availability", y = "Spatial filter based on spatial contiguity") + 
theme_minimal()

# Saving figure
ggsave(file = paste0(diretorio_export_figures,"/spatial_filter_dist_scatterplot.jpg"), 
       plot = spatial_filter_dist_fig,
       width = 16, 
       height = 9, 
       units = "cm", 
       dpi = 300)
```


```{r sf-dist-figure}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(diretorio_export_figures,"/spatial_filter_dist_scatterplot.jpg"))
```

## Spatial filter based on the commute duration  

### Median commmute time

Medians:

```{r distance-medians}
dur_medians <- census_workers %>%
  filter(PwMode %in% c("Bike", "Walk", "Car/motor", "Transit")) %>% 
  group_by(PwMode) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise("Median" =  Hmisc::wtd.quantile(PWDUR, weights = CompW1, probs = 0.5),
            .groups = "drop")

dur_medians
```
After visualizing the creation of a spatial filter for the bike mode, we will generate the spatial filter for each transportation mode:

```{r sf-all-modes}
mode_results <- list()

for (mode in modes) {
  cat("Creating the spatial filter (median duration based) for the transportation mode:", mode, "\n")
  
  # Mode weight matrix
  weight_matrix <- ttm_f %>%
    filter(PwMode == mode) %>%

  dplyr::select(PRCDDA, PwMode, SA_im, Sf) %>% 
  rename(Sf_median_dur = Sf)
```

Pearson  correlation between job spatial availability and spatial filter by transportation mode: 

```{r sf-correlations}
correlations <- spatial_filter_dur_medians %>%
  group_by(PwMode) %>%
  summarise(correlation = cor(SA_im, Sf_median_dur, use = "complete.obs")) 

correlations
```

  group_by(PwMode) %>%
  summarise(r2 = summary(lm(Sf_median_dur ~ SA_im))$r.squared) %>%

### Duration impedance values 

After visualizing the creation of a spatial filter for the bike mode, we will generate the spatial filter for each transportation mode:

```{r sf-all-modes}
mode_results <- list()

for (mode in modes) {
  cat("Creating the spatial filter (duration impedance based) for the transportation mode:", mode, "\n")
  
  # Mode weight matrix
  weight_matrix <- ttm_f %>%
    filter(PwMode == mode) %>% 
    dplyr::select(from_id, to_id, f) %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = to_id, values_from = f, values_fill = 0) %>%
    as.data.frame()
  
  # Compute eigenvectors
  mat <- as.matrix(weight_matrix[, -1])
  ev <- eigen(mat)
  eigv_df <- as.data.frame(Re(ev$vectors))
  colnames(eigv_df) <- paste0("EV", seq_len(ncol(eigv_df)))
  
  weight_matrix_eigv <- cbind(from_id = weight_matrix$from_id, eigv_df)

  # Creating a df with the accessibility values
  y <- SA_mode %>%
    filter(PwMode == mode) %>%
    left_join(weight_matrix_eigv, by = c("PRCDDA" = "from_id")) %>%
    mutate(x = 1, Sf_imp_dur = 0)
  
  # Creating the spatial filter (Sf)
  for (ev_name in names(y)[startsWith(names(y), "EV")]) {
    formula <- as.formula(paste("SA_im ~ x + Sf_imp_dur +", ev_name))
    model <- lm(formula, data = y)
    coefs <- summary(model)$coefficients

    if (ev_name %in% rownames(coefs)) {
      p_value <- coefs[ev_name, "Pr(>|t|)"]
      B_value <- coefs[ev_name, "Estimate"]

      if (!is.na(p_value) && p_value < 0.05) {
        y$Sf_imp_dur <- y$Sf_imp_dur + B_value * y[[ev_name]]
      }
    }
  }
 
 mode_results[[mode]] <- y
}
```

Visualizing creating a data frame with all spatial filters and accessibilities:

```{r sf-df}
spatial_filter_imp_dur <- as.data.frame(bind_rows(mode_results, .id = "PwMode")) %>%
  dplyr::select(PRCDDA, PwMode, SA_im, Sf_imp_dur)

  group_by(PwMode) %>%
  summarise(correlation = cor(SA_im, Sf_imp_dur, use = "complete.obs"))

# Data export

Creating a unique file with all spatial filters (distance, median commute duration, and impedance):

```{r}
spatial_filter <- spatial_filter_dist %>%
  left_join(spatial_filter_dur_medians[,c(1,2,4)], by = c("PRCDDA" = "PRCDDA", "PwMode" = "PwMode")) %>% 
  left_join(spatial_filter_imp_dur[,c(1,2,4)], by = c("PRCDDA" = "PRCDDA", "PwMode" = "PwMode")) 
```

Exporting the spatial filters (original file):

```{r export-spatial-filter-original}
write.csv(spatial_filter, paste0(diretorio_export_tables, "spatial_filter_original.csv"), row.names=FALSE)
```

If you are interested in manipulating the spatial filters outside a RDC Office, the following codes will create a release version that it is in accordance to the confidentiality vetting rules: 

## Confidentiality vetting

Confidentiality vetting is the process of reviewing the results to be released by the Research Data Center to ensure that confidentiality risks for StatCan respondents are minimized. 

The following rules apply to our results:

- *Statistics must not be released for identifiable areas with less than 40 persons ($\sum{CompW1} â¥ 40$)*.	Statistics must not be released for identifiable areas with less than 40 persons. This condition is usually met with geography levels used at the RDCs. The population threshold can be applied to the (long form) weighted population estimate. 

The block above checks the total population of each DA:

```{r da-vetting}
vetting_da_mode <- census %>%
  group_by(PRCDDA, PwMode) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Weighted_pop_mode = sum(CompW1)) %>% 
         dplyr::select(PRCDDA, PwMode, Weighted_pop_mode)
```

Creating new files with the DA population:

```{r creating-release}
spatial_filter_support <- spatial_filter %>% 
  left_join(vetting_da_mode, by = c('PRCDDA' = 'PRCDDA','PwMode' = 'PwMode'))
```

Apply the rules to avoid confidentiality risks for the accessibility tables: 

```{r filter-support}
spatial_filter_support <- spatial_filter_support %>%
  filter(Weighted_pop_mode >= 40) 

spatial_filter_release <- spatial_filter_support %>%
  filter(Weighted_pop_mode >= 40) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-Weighted_pop_mode)
```

To finalize the methodology of this R markdown, we will export the
processed data.

```{r export-release-data}
write.csv(spatial_filter_support, paste0(diretorio_export_tables, "spatial_filter_support.csv"), row.names=FALSE)

write.csv(spatial_filter_release, paste0(diretorio_export_tables, "spatial_filter_release.csv"), row.names=FALSE)
```
